    <h2 id = "explanation">As the simulation runs, healthy circles will first start to appear on the screen. After three seconds, a sick circle will be spanwed, infecting other circles that it touches. After a while(approximately 7 seconds), each sick circles start recovering, and change its color to blue. The circles "live" for 15 seconds after they are spanwed. And for every circle that "dies" and disappear from the screen, a new, healthy circle is "born"(This cycle continues infinitely). When a circle is born, they have a chance of getting vaccinated. If they are vaccinated, then they become immune, and are not able to be infected or infect any other circles.</h2></h1>
